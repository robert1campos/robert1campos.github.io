    <h1>User Test Results</h1>

    <h3>Mahima</h3>

    <p>When Mahima was interacting with my project she was able to navigate through the interface without many issues, and completed the tasks that were prompted. I did notice she was confused when some of the pages weren’t fully functioning, especially with the page for breathing. After the test she did mention that the questions for the journal section did seem a bit repetitive, and she suggested I include more positive and thought provoking questions that could either ask the user what they are grateful for or how they are dealing with their stress today. She also mentioned that the layout of the text could be worked on more, and suggested that the text could be centered more so that the user's attention can go straight to the content. Lastly she mentioned that some of the text was hard to read, especially the white text when the light color of the gradient background is more prevalent. I definitely plan on incorporating Mahima’s feedback on fixing the color contrast of the typefaces against the gradient background for my final project .

    <h3>Alvin</h3>

    <p>When Alvin was completing the tasks he seemed to have no issues completing them, but had similar confusions like Mahima when some of the functions were not working. After the test he did mention that it would be more helpful for the user to include the instructions for each experience on the page. That way the user is not sent to the experience not fully understanding what to do or complete. He also suggested that I position the text areas for the journal page left aligned instead of centered, and that I should have a fixed size for the text area so that it doesn't interfere with other parts of the page layout. The last thing Alvin mentioned was that the positions of the buttons could be more consistent, since some of the buttons seemed to be centered while others weren't. After talking with Alvin I plan on incorporating his suggestions about the alignment and fixed size of the text areas, and his suggestions about the positions of the buttons. </p>
  

    <h3>Caroliine</h3>

    <p>While I was watching Caroline interact with my project I noticed she was able to move through each experience pretty well, but I did see her refresh the page a few times to go back to a certain page. When the user testing was over she first mentioned that it would be easier for the user to navigate through the interface if they were able to go back to previous pages, and she suggested I include back buttons to help that issue. She also mentioned that the color of the gradients for the read section of the interface was not as calming as the initial gradient background, and suggested that I look at more subtle and softer gradients in order to keep a calm and consistent tone throughout the project. Lastly Caroline mentioned that the order of the buttons could be changed so that it suggests more of a chronological order of the experiences. The user could start with breathing, then lead to writing, and then lead to reading. After receiving this feedback from Caroline, I want to incorporate her suggestions about the color gradients so that I can achieve a more consistent tone throughout the interface. </p>
