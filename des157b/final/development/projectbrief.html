    <h1>Project Brief</h1>

    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <p>I intend on making a desktop interface that poses several questions to the user about their mental health and what can help them.</p>

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <p>The goal for my project is to be a source of comfort for the user when they feel very anxious or when they are at a low point mentally.</p>

    <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
    <p>I want the interface to spark joy with the user, and to do that I want to incorporate the use of more vibrant colors such as blues, oranges, or pinks. I am hoping these colors will produce more contrast against the content of the interface. I also want to incorporate more san-serif typefaces in order to achieve proper legibility against more colorful backgrounds. </p>

    <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
    <p>The user will have multiple questions posed to them about their mental health when opening the interface. After these questions the user will choose a coping mechanism from the options provided in order to help with their mental health. I plan on making the choices about 10 to 15 minutes long, in order for the user to have a set time of relaxation.</p>

    <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
    <p>My goal is for those dealing with their mental health to have a moment of calmness when they interact with this interface. I plan on achieving that by providing multiple experiences that could help the user to take a timed break or find a moment for mindfulness. </p>
