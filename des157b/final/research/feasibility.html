<h3>Assessment: </h3> 
<dl>
    <li>Granim</li>
    <dd>- I have not used this JS library before but I feel very confident in being able to work with it. After viewing the examples it seems like a user-friendly tool that I will be able to utilize for the background for visualizations. </dd>
    <li>P5.js</li>
    <dd>- I used this JS library in my last project and I did have some difficulties achieving my ideas . I have more confidence in using it for this project because there are multiple examples of audio visualizations using P5.js.</dd>
    <li>AOS</li>
    <dd>- I have used this JS library in my last project as well and it was very easy to use and I enjoyed the results I achieved from my last project. I plan on using this tool again for some of the text animations in my final project. </dd>
