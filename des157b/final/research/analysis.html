    <h1>Calm</h1>
    <img src="images/screenshot1.jpg" alt="calm app">
    <p>The interface design includes a section where the user can pick the type of stress they are dealing with and they use a calm image as the background of the interface. As the user continues to answer questions the interface transitions to a white background, and the form becomes more simplified. One part of the interface that I thought was helpful for the user experience was when the interface would have a message that thanked the user for offering information about their mental health and tell them “That’s Ok, recognizing how you feel is an important part of mindfulness”.</p>

    <h1>Headspace</h1>
    <img src="images/screenshot2.jpg" alt="headspace app">
    <p>The interface design includes a library of meditations that the user can scroll through depending on the different categories. After clicking on one of the categories an animation will play while the user listens to the meditation. Once the user is done they can view stats and their goals about their meditations.  </p>
